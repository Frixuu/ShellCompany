# Asset licenses

## First-party assets

Any asset files that:

* are not mentioned in this file under the "Third-party assets" section, and
* do not otherwise have a license/attribution attached,

were probably made by me specifically for this game.
And if they were made by me, they probably look very ugly, so why do you even want to reuse them?

Anyway, purpose-made assets are released under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
